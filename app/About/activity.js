Collaborating with talented individuals and exchanging ideas has been truly inspiring. One of the highlights was our company visit to PT Kawasaki Motor Indonesia, where we gained valuable industry insights and learned about innovative business practices. A big thank you to everyone who supported and encouraged me throughout this journey. Your guidance and camaraderie have been invaluable. Looking forward to applying these new insights and connections to future projects! Thanks to Victor Moses and Dian Gloriani Bohalima my lovely partners.", imageUrl: "https://example.com/activity1.jpg",
